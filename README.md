Ever been hashing away real hard on that important document, but Microsoft® Windows® fails you yet again? You see that familiar blue screen and in an instant your revolutionary masterpiece - gone. You suddenly realize that you forgot to hit CTRL+S and that you'll probably never see your high quality masterpiece again. All that hard work down the drain; the last 20 minutes of your life wasted; time you will never get back. 

So now you're frusturated. That's understandable. It's a real shame that BSOD got the best of you yet again. 

You've submitted a bug report to Microsoft® and/or other software vendors resposible. Pats on the back to you. But now what?

You could go back to work on your revolutionary masterpiece, hoping and praying that the software companies did their job right, and that you remember to hit CTRL+S. But can we humans really count on that? I think we all know the right answer here.

The right answer would be to download AutoCTRL+S, a utility that _saves your work for you automatically_ with nothing more on your part than a double click. Just smash that [download](https://github.com/matthew17754/AutoCTRL-S/releases/download/v1.0/AutoCTRL+S.exe) button on the release page and in seconds you'll _probably_ never have to lose another revolutionary masterpiece again.
